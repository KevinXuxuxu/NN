# NN

Deep learning framework written with Python/Numpy for learning purpose.

### TODO

- Transpose layer activation to be more intuitive
- Refactor to introduce operator concept (need design)
- Add more kinds of operators to implement/test more algorithms
    - Convolution layer
    - Other activation functions
    - LSTM (?)
- Performance benchmark
- Better unit/integration testing (how?)
